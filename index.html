He was the "Symbol of Peace" and such a deterrent against crime that villains were largely discouraged by his presence in society, single-handedly bringing near-absolute stability throughout Japan, a stark contrast to the rest of the world. He was able to defeat All For One, infamously known as the world's most powerful villain, twice; a feat that all the previous wielders of One For All could not. Despite winning however, All Might suffered a gruesome injury at the hands of All For One that limited his maximum power output going forward, gradually reducing his sheer might and how long he could use his power at all. <br><br></p></td>
